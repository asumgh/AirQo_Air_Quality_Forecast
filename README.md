# AirQo_Air_Quality_Forecast

The objective of this challenge is to accurately forecast air quality (as measured by PM2.5 Âµ/m3) for each hour of the coming 25 hours across five locations in Kampala Uganda. Forecasts will be based on the past 5 days of hourly air quality measurements at each site.

The ability to accurately predict what air quality will be in the coming days is also essential for empowering everyone from governments to families to make informed decisions to protect health and guide action, just as we do with weather.
